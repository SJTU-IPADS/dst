## Rococo

This is the repo for our OSDI'14 paper: [Extracting More Concurrency from Distributed Transactions](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/mu).

[Rococo] is a novel concurrency control protocol aiming to improve performance for contended distributed transactions.

If you are using Rococo as comparison in your research, we prefer that you email us about your testing setup and results so that we can help make sure that the results are correct.
