*   Description:        Class that handles all of the trading floor activities
*                       for the market. This includes providing functionality
*                       for accepting orders that need to be submitted to the
*                       trading floor, assigning a processing delay time to
*                       the order, and then completing the order after the
*                       processing delay is over.
