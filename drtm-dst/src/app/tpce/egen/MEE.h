/******************************************************************************
*   Description:        This class provides Market Exchange Emulator
*                       functionality. It accepts trade requests for processing;
*                       generates a negative exponential delay for each trade to
*                       simulate the market processing time; manages the
*                       timers for all trades being processed; generates
*                       Trade-Result and Market-Feed input data to be used by a
*                       sponsor provided callback interface to the SUT (see
*                       MEESUTInterface.h).
*
*                       The constructor for this class requires two parameters.
*                       - TradingTimeSoFar: the number of seconds for which
*                       trades have been run against the database. This allows
*                       the MEE to pick up on the price curves from where it
*                       last left off. If doing this isn't important than 0 can
*                       passed in.
*                       - pSUT: a pointer to an instance of a sponsor provided
*                       subclassing of the CMEESUTInterface class.
*
*                       - pLogger: a pointer to an instance of CEGenLogger or a
*                       sponsor provided subclassing of the CBaseLogger class.
*
*                       The MEE provides the following entry points.
*
*                       - SetBaseTime: used to cordinate the price curves
*                       across multiple instances of this class. This method
*                       should be called "at the same time" for all instances.
*                       This call should be made just prior to starting
*                       transactions. There is no return value.
*
*                       - SubmitTradeRequest: used for submitting a trade
*                       request into the market. The return value is the number
*                       of milliseconds before the next timer is set to expire.
*
*                       - GenerateTradeResult: called whenever the current timer
*                       has expired (i.e. whenever the number of milliseconds
*                       returned by either SubmitTradeRequest or
*                       GenerateTradeResult has elapsed). The return value is
*                       the number of milliseconds before the next timer is set
*                       to expire.
*
*                       - DisableTickerTape / EnableTickerTape: by default, the
*                       ticker tape functionality of the MEE is enabled. It can
*                       be disabled, or re-enabled by calls to these methods.
*                       Disabling the ticker tape is useful at the end of a
*                       test run to allow processing of submitted orders to
*                       continue (Trade-Results) while not generating any
*                       ticker tape activity (Market-Feeds).
